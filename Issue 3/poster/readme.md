# m0ire 3 – Poster GeneratorThis is a short discription how the Poster for m0ire #3 (http://m0ire.com/) was generated. The scripts are more like a showcase than a useful program for other users. ## Envoirement * MacOS X 10.9.5* InDesign CS 6 (8.0.2)* Inkscape 0.48.5 r10040## Process* Generate Graphics (SVG)* Convert SVG and generate B/W Picture* Import to InDesign and Export as PDF## Generate Graphics (SVG)Copy the directory `generator` to web server with php execution. The php (`generator/img.php`) is only used to fetch the web cam pictures. Point the browser to `index.html` and click on the button to generate a ZIP file with 100 exports. Attention! This takes a lot of time.Copy the folders to `./DATA/generator/`. Example: `./DATA/generator/73`## Convert SVG and generate B/W PictureUnfortunateley InDesign doesn't support a direct SVG import. To convert the produced graphics from SVG to EPS we take inkscape. The Script in `convert/process.py` converts all the SVG's to EPS and generates 1-Bit TIFF files from the web cam JPEG.## Import to InDesign and Export as PDFTo combine all the generated Files together with the InDesign-Layout and to export it as PDF we run a JavaScript in InDesign: `combine/combine.jsx`# LicenseReleased under the BSD 2-Clause license: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
